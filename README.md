# JavaCollectionFramework
The Java Collection Framework is a set of interfaces and classes provided by Java to handle and manipulate groups of objects. It provides a unified architecture for storing, managing, and manipulating collections of objects. The framework includes several interfaces and classes, such as:

Interfaces:

Collection: The root interface that represents a group of objects.
List: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.
Set: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
Queue: A collection designed for holding elements before processing.
Deque: A double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal at both ends.

Classes:

ArrayList: A dynamic array-based implementation of the List interface.
LinkedList: A doubly-linked list-based implementation of the List and Deque interfaces.
HashSet: A hash table-based implementation of the Set interface.
TreeSet: A sorted set implementation based on a red-black tree.
HashMap: A hash table-based implementation of the Map interface.
TreeMap: A sorted map implementation based on a red-black tree.
These are just a few examples, and there are more interfaces and classes available in the Java Collection Framework. The framework provides various operations to add, remove, iterate, and search for elements within the collections, making it easier to work with groups of objects in Java.
